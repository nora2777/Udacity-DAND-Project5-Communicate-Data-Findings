## Key Insights for Presentation

> We can see that there is a high demand for bikes in October so that the number of trips is the highest whereas the lowest demand was in January where. And that's because of the weather I think, and when you look at the season plot, we find that the number of trips in summer and fall is greater than the number of trips in winter and spring.
